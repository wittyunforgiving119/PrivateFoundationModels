# Same model, different runtimes — Qwen3.5-0.8B on Mac and iPhone

![PrivateFoundationModels runtime comparison: M4 Max vs iPhone Air](media/runtime-comparison-m4max.png)

PFM exposes one Apple-FM-shaped surface and routes generation to whichever runtime you install — Apple's native FoundationModels, CoreML on the Apple Neural Engine, or MLX on Apple Silicon GPU. **Same call site, same prompt, very different latency / throughput.**

This page benches `Qwen3.5-0.8B` on the two runtimes that ship it (CoreML + MLX), plus Apple's native 3 B model and CoreML LFM2.5-350M as reference points. All numbers from `swift run -c release pfm-bench-*` on Apple M4 Max / macOS 26.0 / Xcode 26.1.1, and from the bundled `PFMiPhoneBench` app on iPhone Air (`iPhone18,1`) / iOS 26.4.2 — release builds, median of 3 timed iterations after one untimed warmup.

## Headline

PFM's bench tracks two throughput numbers:

- **E2E chars/sec** = `output_chars / total_ms`. End-to-end user-perceived rate, with prefill latency rolled in. Use this when comparing "how does it feel."
- **Decode chars/sec** = `output_chars / (total_ms − ttft_ms)`. The runtime's pure token-generation rate, with prefill stripped out. Use this when comparing runtimes against each other — TTFT is already on the left chart, so mixing it back into throughput double-penalizes slow-prefill backends.

(For Qwen-family tokenizers on English prompts, ≈ 4 chars per token, so 200 chars/sec ≈ 50 tok/sec.)

### Apple M4 Max (macOS 26.0)

| Backend | Model | Quant | Load | TTFT | Total | Output chars | E2E chars/sec | Decode chars/sec |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MLX / GPU** | **Qwen3.5-0.8B** | **4-bit** | **1 028 ms** | **43 ms** | **114 ms** | 89 | 781 | **1 254** |
| Apple FM | Apple's 3 B (`.general`) | (Apple's own) | 0 ms | 298 ms | 581 ms | 147 | 253 | 519 |
| Apple FM | Apple's 3 B (`.contentTagging`) | (Apple's own) | 1 ms | 496 ms | 523 ms | 53 | 101 | 1 963 ¹ |
| **CoreML / ANE** | **Qwen3.5-0.8B** | **FP16-ish** | 13 224 ms | 526 ms | 1 921 ms | 303 | 158 | **217** |
| CoreML / ANE | LFM2.5-350M (SSM) | FP16-ish | 2 579 ms | 530 ms | 644 ms | 25 | 39 | 219 |

¹ `.contentTagging` finishes the decode in 27 ms and emits 53 chars, so the rate is real but the absolute number is too small to read into. Use `.general` for cross-backend comparisons.

### iPhone Air, `iPhone18,1` (iOS 26.4.2)

| Backend | Model | Quant | Load | TTFT | Total | Output chars | E2E chars/sec | Decode chars/sec |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MLX / GPU** | **Qwen3.5-0.8B** | **4-bit** | 86 980 ms ² | **80 ms** | **231 ms** | 89 | 385 | **589** |
| Apple FM | Apple's 3 B (`.general`) | (Apple's own) | 1 ms | 282 ms | 472 ms | 122 | 258 | 642 |
| **CoreML / ANE** | **Qwen3.5-0.8B** | **FP16-ish** | 1 151 978 ms ² | 560 ms | 2 062 ms | 303 | 147 | **202** |
| CoreML / ANE | LFM2.5-350M (SSM) | FP16-ish | — | — | — | — | — | failed to compile on device ³ |

² First-run load includes HuggingFace download over LTE / Wi-Fi; subsequent loads are cached. The interesting load number is M4 Max (no network).
³ LFM2.5 `mlpackage` failed to build on iOS 26.4.2 (`CoreML failed to build model`); the model loads fine on macOS 26.0 with the same package. Tracking — likely opset / SSM op not yet supported by the iOS CoreML compiler.

**Sanity check.** 202 chars/sec on iPhone CoreML ≈ 50 tok/sec, matching the widely-reported "~49 tok/s on iPhone Pro for Qwen3.5-0.8B CoreML". 217 chars/sec on M4 Max CoreML ≈ 54 tok/sec. The earlier 147/158 numbers were honest E2E throughput but included prefill in the denominator, which made CoreML look slower than its decode loop actually is.

## The runtime gap is architecture-dependent

![Gemma 4 vs Qwen3.5 on iPhone Air, CoreML vs MLX](media/gemma4-runtime-iphone.png)

Running Gemma 4 E2B (2 B effective via matformer + per-layer embeddings) head-to-head with Qwen3.5-0.8B on the same iPhone, same harness:

| Model | Backend | Quant | Load | TTFT | Decode chars/sec | ≈ tok/sec |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.5-0.8B    | CoreML / ANE | FP16-ish | 28 s   | 584 ms | 196 | 49 |
| Qwen3.5-0.8B    | MLX / GPU    | 4-bit    | 1.3 s  | 88 ms  | **568** | **142** |
| Gemma-4-E2B     | CoreML / ANE | FP16-ish | 39 s ¹ | 673 ms | **199** | **50** |
| Gemma-4-E2B     | MLX / GPU    | 4-bit    | 464 s² | 85 ms  | 261 | 65 |

¹ Sideloaded — pushed via `xcrun devicectl device copy to` from the Mac. No HF download. 4.8 GB on-disk (text-only subset: chunk + prefill_chunk + per-layer embed weights + tokenizer).
² First-run HuggingFace download over Wi-Fi. Cold load number — bench again after warm cache for steady-state.

**Two stories.** On Qwen3.5 the MLX vs CoreML decode gap is 2.9× — runtime matters a lot. On Gemma 4 it collapses to **1.3×**. Same iPhone, same prompt; only the model architecture changes. Possible explanations:

- Gemma 4 E2B is a matformer architecture with a 2.2 GB per-layer-embedding table that ANE handles efficiently in its weight-streaming pipeline. MLX has to keep more of that resident on the GPU's shared memory budget.
- MLX 4-bit quantization wins ~3× on simple transformer decode (Qwen) but the matformer's per-layer block hides the GPU's quant advantage — most of the time is in the embedding fetch, not the matmul.
- Whichever way the cause shakes out, the takeaway: "CoreML is slow" is wrong as a sweeping statement. CoreML is slow on naive transformer decode (Qwen-shaped) and competitive on architectures designed for on-device hardware (Gemma 4-shaped). Pick the runtime to match the architecture, not as a blanket choice.

CoreML's ~50 tok/sec is identical between the two models despite Gemma 4 being 2.5× the effective parameter count. Useful corollary: when ANE is the bottleneck (not the model), you can run a bigger model for free.

### Reproducing the Gemma 4 row

The MLX side downloads on first launch (1.5 GB at 4-bit). The CoreML side needs a sideload, which is just a `devicectl` push from your Mac into the bench app's Documents container:

```bash
# Trim the local build to the text-only subset (skip vision/audio/mtp).
SRC=~/Downloads/coreml-llm-artifacts/staging-2k-fast-prefill/gemma4-e2b
DST=/tmp/gemma4-e2b
mkdir -p "$DST"
for it in chunk{1,2,3,4}.mlmodelc prefill_chunk{1,2,3,4}.mlmodelc \
          *.npy *.bin model_config.json hf_model; do
  cp -R "$SRC/$it" "$DST/" 2>/dev/null
done
# Push to iPhone (~2-3 min over USB-C).
xcrun devicectl device copy to --device <UDID> \
  --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier dev.pebble.PFMiPhoneBench \
  --source "$DST" --destination "Documents/Models/"
```

Then build and run the [`PFMiPhoneBench`](../Examples/PFMiPhoneBench/) app from Xcode — `BenchView.swift` auto-detects the sideloaded bundle and adds it to the plan list.

Raw CSV: [`docs/BENCHMARKS.csv`](BENCHMARKS.csv) — accumulates per-hardware contributions over time.

## Same model on CoreML vs MLX

This is the apples-to-apples row. Same architecture (`Qwen3.5-0.8B`), same prompt, same `GenerationOptions(temperature: 0.0, maximumResponseTokens: 80)`. Different runtime, different quantization.

```

**The runtime gap holds on iPhone too.** MLX (Metal GPU, 4-bit) beats CoreML (ANE, FP16) by 7× on TTFT and 2.9× on decode throughput for the same Qwen3.5-0.8B weights. The advantage is smaller than on M4 Max (12.2× TTFT / 5.8× decode) — the iPhone GPU is closer to its ANE than M4 Max's GPU is — but it's still big enough that "CoreML is always the iPhone default" is just folklore.

### Caveats — read these before tweeting the numbers

1. **Not the same precision.** MLX is 4-bit; CoreML build of the same repo is FP16-ish. ~3× of the decode-throughput gap is the quant alone; the remaining ~1.9× on M4 Max (and ~1× on iPhone, where the gap collapses once prefill is stripped) is runtime/hardware path (GPU Metal vs ANE).
2. **Different output lengths.** Within the same 80-token cap, MLX stopped at 89 chars (~80 tokens of concise reply); CoreML kept generating to 303 chars before hitting the cap. Both throughput numbers are honest (output bytes / wall time over their respective windows) but don't normalize for "how much did the model decide to say."
3. **Both stop conditions are model-controlled.** Same prompt, but Apple's framework and the upstream Qwen instruction-tuning differ in verbosity defaults. Decode throughput is the cleaner of the two metrics for runtime comparison; TTFT is unambiguous.
4. **iPhone energy is unmeasured.** ANE is more energy-efficient per token than the GPU on iPhone — this bench measures latency and throughput, not joules. If your app generates continuously (live captions, agents, etc.), the CoreML / ANE path may still win on battery even though MLX wins on wall-clock.
5. **iPhone first-load is dominated by network.** The 87 s MLX load and 1 152 s CoreML load on iPhone are first-run HuggingFace downloads. Subsequent launches load from disk in single-digit seconds. Bench again after warm cache if you want the steady-state number.

## Apple FM as a reference point

Apple's native on-device LLM (`SystemLanguageModel.default` on iOS 26+) is a 3 B-class model — bigger than Qwen3.5-0.8B but smaller than mid-range cloud models. It sits between the two Qwen runtimes on PFM's bench:

- 5.9× faster TTFT than CoreML/ANE on Qwen 0.8B (despite being a much bigger model).
- 6.9× slower TTFT than MLX/GPU on Qwen 0.8B 4-bit.

The big wins for Apple FM in PFM:
- **Zero load time.** The model is built into the OS — no download, no MLPackage compile, no Metal shader paging.
- **Schema-enforced JSON** via Apple's grammar-constrained sampler. CoreML / MLX use prompt-injection + post-process for `@Generable`.
- **Guardrails managed by Apple.** Not always what you want, but a thing.

The big wins for the other backends:
- **MLX:** raw speed on Apple Silicon GPU. Bring-your-own-model.
- **CoreML:** ANE / battery efficiency on iPhone (and yes, MLX on iPhone is still GPU; CoreML wins energy there).

## When to pick which runtime

| You want | Pick |
|---|---|
| Fastest first token, Mac dev box | MLX |
| Smallest binary footprint, iPhone, your own model | CoreML |
| Zero download, Apple's grammar sampler, iOS 26+ only | Apple FM |
| One call site that runs on all three depending on what's available | PFM |

## Reproducing

### Mac

```bash
# CoreML (works from SPM CLI)
swift run -c release pfm-bench-coreml --model qwen3.5-0.8B --csv-append docs/BENCHMARKS.csv

# MLX (needs xcodebuild — Metal shaders)
xcodebuild -scheme pfm-bench-mlx -configuration Release \
  -destination "platform=macOS" -skipMacroValidation build
$(find ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData -name pfm-bench-mlx -path "*Release*" -type f | head -1) \
  --csv-append docs/BENCHMARKS.csv

# Apple FM (macOS 26+, Apple Intelligence on)
swift run -c release pfm-bench-apple --csv-append docs/BENCHMARKS.csv
```

Pass `--hardware "<your label>"` if you want a friendlier name than the auto-detected CPU brand string (`Apple M4 Max`, `Apple M2`, etc.).

### iPhone

```bash
# Generate the xcodeproj and open it once to set your own development team.
cd Examples/PFMiPhoneBench
xcodegen
open PFMiPhoneBench.xcodeproj
```

Build to your device once from Xcode (Cmd-R). The app auto-starts the bench
on first appearance, runs Apple FM + CoreML + MLX (median of 3), and writes
`pfm-bench-latest.csv` into the app's Documents container after every
backend so a mid-run crash doesn't lose data. Tap **Share CSV** to AirDrop
or Files-export the result, then append the rows to
[`docs/BENCHMARKS.csv`](BENCHMARKS.csv) and open a PR.
