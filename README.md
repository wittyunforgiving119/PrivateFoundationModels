# PrivateFoundationModels

**Apple's [Foundation Models framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels) — without the iOS 26 requirement, and with any on-device model you choose.**

```swift
import PrivateFoundationModels
import PrivateFoundationModelsCoreML

SystemLanguageModel.default = SystemLanguageModel(
    backend: try await CoreMLLanguageModel.load(.lfm2_5_350M)
)

let session = LanguageModelSession(
    instructions: "You are a Swift documentation assistant."
)

let reply = try await session.respond(to: "What is `async let`?")
print(reply.content)
```

That's the same `LanguageModelSession.respond(to:)` shape Apple ships in iOS 26 — running on iOS 18, on LFM2.5-350M, on the Neural Engine, fully on-device.

**This is verified, not aspirational** — the full scenario matrix (load, respond, streamResponse, Generable, Tool calling, Transcript round-trip) ran green on an Apple M4 Max against the real model. See [`docs/VERIFICATION.md`](docs/VERIFICATION.md) for the captured log.

## Why this exists

Apple's `FoundationModels` framework is great. It also has three real constraints:

| | Apple `FoundationModels` | `PrivateFoundationModels` |
|---|---|---|
| **Minimum OS** | iOS 26 / macOS 26 / visionOS 26 | iOS 18 / macOS 15 / visionOS 2 |
| **Model** | Apple's 3 B on-device model, locked | Any CoreML / MLX / GGUF bundle |
| **Adapter support** | Limited, ~90% context budget burned by adapter | Bring your own LoRA / fine-tune |
| **Domain coverage** | Apple-recommended only — coding, math, general Q&A all officially discouraged | Whatever your chosen model is good at |
| **API surface** | `LanguageModelSession` / `Instructions` / `Tool` / `Generable` | Same names, same shapes |

If you've already written code against Apple's framework, point it at `PrivateFoundationModels` and it builds. If you haven't, the migration path the day iOS 26 hits is `s/PrivateFoundationModels/FoundationModels/` and a deployment-target bump.

## Install

```swift
// Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/john-rocky/PrivateFoundationModels", from: "0.1.0"),
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "MyApp",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "PrivateFoundationModels",        package: "PrivateFoundationModels"),
            .product(name: "PrivateFoundationModelsCoreML", package: "PrivateFoundationModels"),
        ]
    )
]
```

Two products:

- **`PrivateFoundationModels`** — the API surface (`LanguageModelSession`, `Instructions`, …). Zero runtime deps. Import this everywhere.
- **`PrivateFoundationModelsCoreML`** — the default backend. Depends on [`john-rocky/CoreML-LLM`](https://github.com/john-rocky/CoreML-LLM), which runs Gemma 4 / Qwen3.5 / Qwen3-VL / LFM2.5 / FunctionGemma / EmbeddingGemma on the Apple Neural Engine. Import only in the target that wires `SystemLanguageModel.default`.

You can also wire your own `LanguageModelBackend` (MLX-Swift, llama.cpp, a remote API) — see [Bring your own backend](#bring-your-own-backend) below.

## Quick tour

### Stateful chat

```swift
let session = LanguageModelSession(instructions: "Be terse.")

_ = try await session.respond(to: "Who wrote The Tale of Genji?")
_ = try await session.respond(to: "And in what century?")
// The second call sees the first in `session.transcript`.
```

### Streaming

```swift
let stream = session.streamResponse(to: "Write a haiku about autumn.")
for try await snapshot in stream {
    print(snapshot.content) // cumulative, not deltas
}
let final = try await stream.collect()
```

### Structured output

```swift
struct CityReport: Generable {
    let city: String
    let temperatureCelsius: Double
    let conditions: String

    static var generationSchema: GenerationSchema {
        GenerationSchema(
            type: "object",
            properties: [
                "city":                .init(type: "string"),
                "temperatureCelsius":  .init(type: "number"),
                "conditions":          .init(type: "string"),
            ],
            required: ["city", "temperatureCelsius", "conditions"]
        )
    }
}

let report = try await session.respond(
    to: "Make up plausible weather for Tokyo in November.",
    generating: CityReport.self
)
print(report.content.temperatureCelsius)
```

### Tools

```swift
struct LookupTool: Tool {
    struct Arguments: Generable {
        let city: String
        static var generationSchema: GenerationSchema {
            GenerationSchema(
                type: "object",
                properties: ["city": .init(type: "string")],
                required: ["city"]
            )
        }
    }
    let name = "lookup_weather"
    let description = "Returns the current temperature in °C for a city."
    func call(arguments: Arguments) async throws -> String {
        // Hit your real API here.
        "22"
    }
}

let session = LanguageModelSession(
    tools: [LookupTool()],
    instructions: "Use lookup_weather when asked about temperature."
)
let reply = try await session.respond(to: "How warm is it in Tokyo?")
```

Tool calls and tool outputs are recorded in `session.transcript` as `.toolCall` / `.toolOutput` entries so the conversation survives serialization.

### Persisting and restoring

```swift
let json = try session.transcript.serialized()
try json.write(to: url)
// ... later ...
let restored = try Transcript(serialized: Data(contentsOf: url))
let session = LanguageModelSession(transcript: restored)
```

### Sampling

```swift
let options = GenerationOptions(
    sampling: .random(top: 40, probabilityThreshold: 0.95, seed: 42),
    temperature: 0.7,
    maximumResponseTokens: 256
)
let answer = try await session.respond(to: "Tell me a story.", options: options)
```

## Model catalog

The CoreML backend ships with these defaults (see [`CoreMLLanguageModel.Catalog`](Sources/PrivateFoundationModelsCoreML/CoreMLLanguageModel.swift)):

| Catalog case | HuggingFace repo | Size | iPhone 17 Pro decode | v0.1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.lfm2_5_350M` | `mlboydaisuke/lfm2.5-350m-coreml` | 810 MB | ~52 tok/s | ✅ verified |
| `.gemma4E2B` | `mlboydaisuke/gemma-4-E2B-coreml` | 5.4 GB | ~34 tok/s | ✅ chunked path |
| `.gemma4E4B` | `mlboydaisuke/gemma-4-E4B-coreml` | 5.5 GB | ~14 tok/s | ✅ chunked path |
| `.qwen3_5_0_8B` | `mlboydaisuke/qwen3.5-0.8B-CoreML` | 1.2 GB | ~48 tok/s | ⚠ needs v0.2 generator routing |
| `.qwen3_5_2B` | `mlboydaisuke/qwen3.5-2B-CoreML` | 2.8 GB | ~27 tok/s | ⚠ same |
| `.qwen3VL2BStateful` | `mlboydaisuke/qwen3-vl-2b-stateful-coreml` | 2.3 GB | ~24 tok/s | ⚠ same |

Numbers from CoreML-LLM's published benchmarks. Any other CoreML bundle that CoreML-LLM can load via `CoreMLLLM.load(repo:)` works via `.custom("user/repo-coreml")`. The Qwen family loads through a separate Swift type in CoreML-LLM (`Qwen35MLKVGenerator`); routing those catalog entries through that path is the v0.2 milestone, see [`docs/VERIFICATION.md`](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

## Bring your own backend

`SystemLanguageModel` doesn't care how text is generated — it talks to a `LanguageModelBackend`. Implement two methods (`generate(...)` and `streamGenerate(...)`), and an `availability` property, and you can route the same Apple-FM-shaped surface to MLX-Swift, llama.cpp, a private inference server, or a remote API.

```swift
struct MyMLXBackend: LanguageModelBackend {
    let modelIdentifier = "mlx/my-finetune"
    var availability: SystemLanguageModel.Availability { .available }

    func prewarm() async { /* ... */ }

    func generate(
        transcript: Transcript,
        options: GenerationOptions,
        schema: GenerationSchema?,
        tools: [AnyTool]
    ) async throws -> BackendGeneration {
        let text = try await myMLXEngine.run(prompt: render(transcript))
        return BackendGeneration(text: text)
    }

    func streamGenerate(
        transcript: Transcript,
        options: GenerationOptions,
        schema: GenerationSchema?,
        tools: [AnyTool]
    ) -> AsyncThrowingStream<BackendDelta, Error> {
        AsyncThrowingStream { /* ... */ }
    }
}

SystemLanguageModel.default = SystemLanguageModel(backend: MyMLXBackend())
```

The session takes care of the transcript, the tool-call loop, and the `Generable` decode. Backends only have to render → run → emit text or a `toolCalls` array.

## Compatibility with `FoundationModels`

This package mirrors the public API surface of `FoundationModels` (iOS 26+) as of WWDC 2025 and the documentation available at the time of writing. Type names, initializer shapes, and method signatures match. A non-exhaustive list of what's implemented:

- `LanguageModelSession` — `respond(to:)`, `respond(to:generating:)`, `streamResponse(to:)`, `streamResponse(to:generating:)`, `prewarm()`, `transcript`, `isResponding`
- `Instructions`, `GenerationOptions`, `SamplingMode`
- `Response<Content>`, `ResponseStream<Content>` (AsyncSequence with `Snapshot`)
- `Transcript` + `Transcript.Entry` (Codable)
- `Tool` protocol, `AnyTool` type-erased wrapper
- `Generable` protocol with `GenerationSchema`
- `SystemLanguageModel` with `Availability` / `UnavailableReason`
- `GenerationError` matching Apple's case names where they exist

Things Apple's `FoundationModels` ships that we do **not** ship today, and explicitly do not promise:

- `@Generable` macro for auto-deriving `generationSchema` from a struct's stored properties. Conform manually for now; macro support is on the roadmap.
- `Instructions(@InstructionsBuilder ...)` builder syntax. Use the plain string initializer.
- Apple Intelligence-specific behavior (rewriting in Mail, image playgrounds). Those are app-level features, not framework surface.

If you find a method or initializer in Apple's docs that PFM doesn't ship, please open an issue.

## What this package is *not*

- **Not affiliated with Apple.** "Foundation Models" is Apple's trademark; this project is a community-maintained API-compatible alternative.
- **Not a model.** It's a thin Swift surface that delegates to whatever backend you wire up.
- **Not a grammar-constrained sampler.** When you ask for a `Generable` response, we feed the schema to the model as part of the system prompt and post-process. For deterministic schema enforcement, use a backend that supports a constrained sampler (Outlines, LM Format Enforcer, Apple FM's own grammar mode).

---

## Roadmap

- v0.1 — Core API + CoreML backend (this release)
- v0.2 — `@Generable` macro for auto-schema derivation
- v0.3 — MLX-Swift backend
- v0.4 — llama.cpp / GGUF backend
- v0.5 — Grammar-constrained decoding for the CoreML backend (via FunctionGemma for schema-restricted output)
- v0.6 — Vision input on the session API (so multimodal models like Qwen3-VL accept images via `respond(to:image:)`)
